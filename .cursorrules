## Important Notes

1. **DO NOT run `npm run dev`** - This project is running in a Replit environment and should only be operated using Replit's built-in tools and interfaces.

2. **Use the Replit interface** - View and interact with the application through the Replit preview window.

3. **API development** - When developing new API endpoints, test them using the built-in API testing tools or the application interface.

4. **Database access** - Database operations should be performed through the application's models and controllers.

## Project Structure

- `server/` - Backend Express API
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations
